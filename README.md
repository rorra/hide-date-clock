# hide-date-clock gnome shell extension

This project is a partial fork from https://github.com/grantmcwilliams/Gnome_Hide_Clock.

I didn't see further updates from the original author, and needed this extension
for gnome shell extensions version 42.0

I'll be supporting the extension for current version and further versions.

Original author is Grant McWilliams (https://github.com/grantmcwilliams)
